    <abbr>Archaeologists discovered evidence of prehistoric rock art—carvings or drawings on cave rocks—in this area dating back at least 290,000 years. The oldest examples are the Bhimbetka petroglyphs found in central India. The earliest known Indian art sculptures were produced by the Indus Valley Civilization between 2,500 B.C. and 1,800 B.C. 
        Rock art continued to be created as cave paintings, representing animals and humans. The oldest examples of these paintings date from about 7000 BCE.</abbr>

    <abbr>From the 2nd Century B.C., the Indus Valley Civilisation flourished in the northwest area of the country, which is Pakistan to the present date.
         The evolution towards a sophisticated and civilised culture happened in the Harappan period. Roughly dating somewhere from 3200-1200,
         the history of Indian Art during the Indus Valley civilisation is observed to be influenced by the advancements that happened in Science and Culture. 
        The artistic expression of this period can be traced back to Rock paintings and Temple Arts. The people of the Indus valley civilization produced the earliest known Indian art sculptures, from between 2500 and 1800 BCE.
         They were small terracotta and bronze figures depicting animals and humans, like cows, monkeys, and dancing positions</abbr>
