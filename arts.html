    <p class="para">Archaeologists discovered evidence of prehistoric rock art—carvings or drawings on cave rocks—in this area dating back at least 290,000 years. The oldest examples are the Bhimbetka petroglyphs found in central India. The earliest known Indian art sculptures were produced by the Indus Valley Civilization between 2,500 B.C. and 1,800 B.C. 
        Rock art continued to be created as cave paintings, representing animals and humans. The oldest examples of these paintings date from about 7000 BCE.</p>

    <p class="para">From the 2nd Century B.C., the Indus Valley Civilisation flourished in the northwest area of the country, which is Pakistan to the present date.
         The evolution towards a sophisticated and civilised culture happened in the Harappan period. Roughly dating somewhere from 3200-1200,
         the history of Indian Art during the Indus Valley civilisation is observed to be influenced by the advancements that happened in Science and Culture. 
        The artistic expression of this period can be traced back to Rock paintings and Temple Arts. The people of the Indus valley civilization produced the earliest known Indian art sculptures, from between 2500 and 1800 BCE.
         They were small terracotta and bronze figures depicting animals and humans, like cows, monkeys, and dancing positions</p>

         <p class="para">Buddhism originated in India at some point in the 6th century BCE. Religious artists made sculpture pieces, including stone and bronze. They also produced magnifi
            cent examples of Indian cave art, with entire temples being carved in stone and decorated with Greek-influenced columns and sculptures. By the 5th century CE, the sculpture was a common practice among Indian Buddhists and Hindus. 
            Hinduism continued to be the focus of art creation for centuries, sculptures of Shiva and other deities, and huge stone temples like the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, built in the 11th century in northern India.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="para"> The history of Madhubani paintings is said to date back to the time of Ramayana which is about 2500 years ago. King Janaka, ruler of Mithila Kingdom in the 8th or 7th century BCE, requested an artist to represent the wedding of his daughter, Sita, 
                to Prince Rama.The paintings are, basically, spiritually inspired. In both portraits, the central theme is passion and fertility. They are made in specific rooms in the home, such
                 as the prayer room, the ceremonial place, the bridal room, or the village's main walls to greet guests, etc. The sketches of nature and mythology are changed and tailored according to the theme of each area, as well as the individual artist.
                 And since then, whenever any house of Mithila celebrated a happy occasion, people drew Madhubani paintings on the walls of their houses</p>

                 </figure>
                 <p class="para">Warli paintings are believed to be one of the oldest form of art in history. It is a form of tribal art which owes its origin to the state of Maharashtra in India. This art is very popular among the tribal community,
                     however till date it has not gained any special recognition outside India.The Warli tribe is one of the largest in India, located outside of Mumbai. Despite being close to one of the largest cities in India, the Warli reject much of contemporary culture. The style of Warli painting was not recognised until the 1970s,
                      even though the tribal style of art is thought to date back as early as 10th century A.D.
                      The Warli culture is centered around the concept of Mother Nature and elements of nature are often focal points depicted in Warli painting. Farming is their main way of life and a large source of food for the tribe. They greatly respect nature and wildlife for the resources that they provide for life.
                     Warli artists use their clay huts as the backdrop for their paintings, similar to how ancient people used cave walls as their canvases.</p>
